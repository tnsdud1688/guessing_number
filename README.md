# guessing_number


I did this project to make a game.
This is called guessing number with Python.
The processing goes like at the beginning python ask you about the random number.
If we put the any random number between 0 and 10,
then python says up down or you are right 
If number that you guessed is higher than picked number then system will say down
If number that you guessed is lower than picked number then system will say up
If number that you guessed is equal to picked number than system will say you are right
To get this processing 
I used loop and if function.

The code is short and organized, so I think you guys can understand easily.
